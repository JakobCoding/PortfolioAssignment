## Purpose and Target Audience 
As an aspiring web developer the purpose for undertaking this task was to create a website that displays my skills, background and current projects that I am working on. I decided the best way to do this was to produce a website that is professional, stylish, modern, interactive and easy to navigate. I wanted to produce a site that would engage potential employers while also making it very easy to contact me via social media links and a call to action contact form at the bottom of each page, a direct link to my CV was also attached. My email and contact number information was displayed clearly and I made sure to attach the international call code just in case prospective employers not only from Australia but also other parts of the world were able to contact me. I structured the website this way to showcase what a real business website could potentially look like and the elements that can be utilized in order to promote and advertise an employerâ€™s company or business. Target audience is prospective employers in the IT field, local businesses, startup firms and ecommerce entrepreneurs who could use the services of a web developer.
