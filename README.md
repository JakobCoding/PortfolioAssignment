## Purpose and Target Audience 
As an aspiring web developer the purpose for undertaking this task was to create a website that displays my skills, background and current projects. I believe the best way to do this was to produce a website that is professional, stylish, modern, interactive and easy to navigate. I wanted to produce a site that would engage potential employers while also making it very easy to contact me via social media links and a call to action contact form at the bottom of each page and a direct link to my CV. My email and contact number information was also displayed clearly and I made sure to attach the international call code to make it an easy process for prospective employers to contact me not only from australia but also other parts of the world. I structured the website this way to showcase what a real business website could potentialy look like and the elements that can be ulitilised in order to promote and advertise an employers potential business to enable it to scale. Target audience is prospective employers in the IT field and also local business owners who might need a website and startup firms, eCommerce entrepreneurs who could use the services of a web developer.
